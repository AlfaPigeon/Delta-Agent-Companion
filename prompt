you will create a blueprint.md file:

This file will be an artitectural blueprint that has every step of the implementation of a AI Companion.

This AI companion will use llm models to process information both from its state data, context, memory and user input and enviroment state.

Everything in this project should be modular, configurable and best practice.

At its core I want the AI companion to have a behavior tree state machine. But it can decide to add or remove from this behaviour tree states(Except root state).

It will have a memory system, it will not record everything just Abridging the memory entries unless it is decided that it is important information.

Memories will be associated with also states, they will have a weight to them. When they are called they will get stronger, giving them more context.

This AI companion will be able to use tools. it will read this tools from a folder. call them when needed. The user will provide these tools but companion will decide when to use them accourding to their description.(it can dedicate states for spesific tools)

I want you to use eleven labs conversation ai for in and output but for debug purpoises also add a chat UI optional.

This companion will work on an open window (with options, and input-output). But when closed it should go back into system tray(if eleven labs is on it should listen to output and respond only when it is in context)

in this blueprint.md I want you to create a clear structure of 
- implementation
- algoritms disected into steps
- features

Also do think about missing structures, and nice to haves.
